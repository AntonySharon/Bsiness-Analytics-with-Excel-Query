With Power Query (known as Get & Transform in Excel), you can import or connect to external data, and then shape that data, for example remove a column, change a data type, or merge tables, in ways that meet your needs. Then, you can load your query into Excel to create charts and reports. Periodically, you can refresh the data to make it up to date. Power Query is available on three Excel applications, Excel for Windows, Excel for Mac and Excel for the Web.

There are four phases to using Power Query:
  * Connect    Make connections to data in the cloud, on a service, or locally
  * Transform    Shape data to meet your needs, while the original source remains unchanged
  * Combine    Integrate data from multiple sources to get a unique view into the data
  * Load   Complete your query and load it into a worksheet or Data Model and periodically refresh it.
